📲 Alarm/Reminder Set Karne Ka Tarika

1. Use Google Calendar (Recommended)

Daily event add karo with title like: “Day 142 – Learn CSRF”

Set notification: morning 9am or evening 8pm

Optionally, use repeat feature for topics >1 day



2. To-Do Apps (e.g., TickTick, Google Tasks, Microsoft To Do)

Daily tasks bana lo, check karte raho

Reminder, color tag, and progress milega



3. Excel/Notion Tracker?

Agar chaho to main tumhare liye pura schedule Excel ya Notion template me bhi bana sakta hoon (daily checkbox + notes).
